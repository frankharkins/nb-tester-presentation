The only magic we really use is the `%%writefile` magic, which we use to write a cell to disk rather than executing it. We have some display logic in inner-source that detects the `%%writefile` magic and displays the cell differently to the user. See https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/serverless-manage-resources#set-detailed-statuses for an example. \n",
